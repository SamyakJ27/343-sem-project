# Version Control System
## CECS 343 - Sec 06 
### Gung Hoes - James, Samyak, Rishika, Rifat

This purpose of this project is to mirror a version control system similar to github. This repository stores a semester-long project assigned by Charles Siska, the professor of CS 343 at CSULB.

## Contents: 
background.jpg, files.html, files.js, package-lock.json, package.json, vcsbridge.js, vcswebsite.html, style.css, README.md   

## External Requirements: 
Node Js, Express Js

## Setup & Installation: 
Need to install node and express Js and type in `node vcsbridge` into console to run the server and use this program. 

## Results: 
When code is inputted into form text boxes, user should see a responsive message acknowledging their action then logging that into the server.

## Features: 
Users can create a repository that is stored onto their local storage, rollback their work from previous repos, and finally pushing the code. A command line interface is also provided to go through the versions and move throughout the folders. With each submission, an artifactID is attached so that the user is informed when a push or change has been made.

## Bugs: 
(none)
