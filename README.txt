## Bootleg VCS
### Gung Hoes - James, Samyak, Rishika, Rifat

This purpose of this project is to mirror a version control system similar to github.

Contents: background.jpg, files.html, files.js, package-lock.json, package.json, vcsbridge.js, vcswebsite.html, style.css, README.md  

External Requirements: Node Js, Express Js

Setup & Installation: Need to isntall node and express Js and type in `node vcsbridge` into console to run the server and use this program. Go to web browser and search up "localhost:3000" to launch this on to a responsive webpage.

Results: When code is inputted into form text boxes, user should see a responsive message acknowledging their action then logging that into the server. Go back to the previous window to resume other processes. Do this for each results page.

Features: Users can create a repository that is stored onto their local storage, rollback their work from previous repos, and finally pushing the code. A command line interface is also provided to go through the versions and move throughout the folders. With each submission, an artifactID is attached so that the user is informed when a push or change has been made.

Bugs: When the merge out button is called upon, there's an artifact ID that is named .sourcebranch.txt as it is copied over into another folder.
